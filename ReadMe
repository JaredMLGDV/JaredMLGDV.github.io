Hello from the BrowseDNS and Switchbru community. this is Jared. hard at work to make a change to things around here

i am not a moderator from BrowseDNS. i have spite from the fact that they went and changed the site for the worst. there used to be no ads on the site. and now
THERE IS LITERALLY 3 FUCKING ADS ON THE SITE. a big downstep. My site will be open to every1 and will be more in line than Browsedns. just starting somewhere in my
coding adventures
